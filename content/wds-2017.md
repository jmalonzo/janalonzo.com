# Web Directions Summit 2017

Last week I attended the [Web Directions Summit](https://www.webdirections.org/wds/) in Sydney. There were surprisingly *a lot* more
good talks and brilliant speakers compared to previous years (thank God).

Below is a rundown of what I've learned during those two days attending the conf:

* Web performance engineering is not just for our users, it's also for us as we age and our focus and patience decreases over time.
* Conversational UX through bots and voice is and will be the next *killer* features for apps.
* [CSS Blocks](http://css-blocks.com) is the new kid on the block for design systems and web/app components.
* WebXR 2.0, combining AR and VR, is coming soon.

I think those are the big things that are at the edges (i.e. new-ish) that I care about as they affect the areas I'm interested in, and the ones that are worth exploring for me anyway.

For a more detailed overview of the event, read [Ben Buchanan's awesome post](http://weblog.200ok.com.au/2017/11/wds17-big-stonking-post.html).
