# Instagram Stories

I've never appreciated Instagram Stories. I think this is due to the fact that it came after Snapchat, and I've somehow (mistakenly) compared it to Snapchat which is the wrong comparison to make. When I first started using IG Stories, I've always used it like how I used Snapchat, partly because that's how people I follow use it. And my impression to the *vlog* format is that **it's not me** and I just didn't have the time to do all that.

But over time I've understood that *it is NOT* Snapchat, although it can be used that way of course. It should've been obvious in the first place - the name itself says ***Stories*** - but other people's usage of it had an effect on how I ended up using it.

So hopefully I'll be smarter when and when not to use it. I'd love to get into story-telling sometime and hopefully, that'll be the platform I will be starting with.
