I have always
liked computers and technology, even though I started relatively late
in programming, I have always enjoyed it since. I love making things
work, but more importantly, I love it when people appreciate and find
my work useful or interesting. In my free time, I am a hobbyist
photographer. These days I'm mostly interested in landscape
photography. Photography is interesting to me as it involves
creativity and some technicalities, which interests me a bit and takes
my mind of computer stuff even for a short time. I am working full-time at Taguchi as a senior developer. I find it interesting to work with great people as well as work on interesting projects, especially ones that involve new tech.
