It's been a while since I had a blog. Back then I was a young and
naive, and didn't really have a purpose both in writing and somewhat
in life. Fast-forward to today I've grown maturely both professionally
and personally, as well as emotionally and to some intellectually (oh
god!).

So this year I'm going to *practice* my writing more. A lot of it
won't be pretty and possibly full of grammatical mistakes. But I need
to grow and get more experienced in writing about topics that I care
most about.

It will be mostly short writing. The rest of my brainfarts will still
remain at brainfart central, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmalonzo).
