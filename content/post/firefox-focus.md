I've been using [Firefox Focus](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus) in the last few months. It's a great product with ad-blocking amd incognito-mode out-of-the-box, and this works perfectly if you're someone who opens an article and reads them straightaway.

But these past couple of weeks, and ever since this year started, I've modified my workflow to be more productive (e.g. batching my social media time which means I also have to batch articles opened through social media). The side-effect is that I usually end up with at least 3-5 long-running tabs in Firefox Focus that I'm *planning* to read in my next break/downtime cycle. But most of the time, I only get to read about 3-4 articles (some articles require more time, or too heavy to read in the time available). And by the time I come back to read the next batch of articles, they're already gone due to me closing the app (which nukes all the tabs) or my battery runs out and the app automatically shuts down. I've lost a lot of good articles I wanted to read because of this.

So now I'm back to Google Chrome on my mobile. I really liked Firefox Focus but the stateless/incognito-mode feature isn't just for me. I considered going back to [Brave](https://brave.com/) but I realised Chrome will add a native ad-blocking feature next month so I might as well use it and take advantage of its other features like open-tab syncing so I can also read articles on my desktop.
