Last month, I dropped my backup phone (S3) and shattered parts of the
LCD. So I thought I'll have it repaired. It turns out cheap repairs
don't always work out as well as it should. 

So I decided that I'll try to use a tablet that's small enough and light
enough for everyday use. Like a phone.

Enter the [8.4" Galaxy Tab S](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/SM-T700NZWAXAR).

The Galaxy Tab S is light, and very thin. You can't hold it in one
hand but general usage is no different to your standard phablet. In
addition, the Tab S has a Super AMOLED screen which means it's
ultra-sharp. It's the same screen as in the newer Galaxy Note 4s. I
don't think I would ever want to go back to a non-ultra sharp screen
after using a Super AMOLED screen.

Some pros and cons:

Pros

* Large screen makes for great viewing, content consumption. Movies,
reading, browsing, etc...

Cons

* Too big to use for chat apps. I talk to my girlfriend plenty of
  times and typing on these things even with two hands is annoying.
  And lots of typos. I even contemplated going to back to the Note 3
  because it's much easier to use chat apps there.
